This is capojame's portfolio app as requested here:

Llamo esto portfolia porque es mismo que portfolio pero la final letra es 'a'.

The html directory will contain a static dummy-prototype.

The css directory will contain the stylesheets that will probably survive to the dynamic version.

The goal of this project initially is to refine the CSS/SCSS to exactly what
the end-result will look like, because it appears the remaining portions of this course pertain to back-end application development.

The course up until this point has been all about front-end development.  So it is reasonable to ask for the final CSS/SCSS at this stage.  The static HTML content won't survive because it'll be chopped up into peices to be used in dynamic-HTML, pre-processed by the application server before being sent to a web browser.
